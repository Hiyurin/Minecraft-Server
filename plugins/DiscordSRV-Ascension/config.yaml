# Channels configuration
#  
# This is where everything related to in-game chat channels is configured.
# The key of this option is the in-game channel name (the default keys are "global" and "default")
# channel-ids and threads can be configured for all channels except "default"
# "default" is a special section which has the default values for all channels unless they are specified (overridden) under the channel's own section
# So if you don't specify a certain option under a channel's own section, the option will take its value from the "default" section
channels:
    global:
        # The text and/or voice channel ids this in-game channel will forward to in Discord
        channel-ids:
        - 1260133453471547422
        
        # The threads that this in-game channel will forward to in Discord (this can be used instead of or with the channel-ids option)
        threads:
